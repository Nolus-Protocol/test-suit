# Integration tests

<br /><p align="center"><img alt="nolus-test-suit" src="docs/test-suit-logo.svg" width="100"/></p><br />

## Prerequisites

* Node v14+

* [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#debian-stable)

* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/)

* [jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)

    You can run Jest directly from the CLI if it is globally available in your PATH:

    ```sh
    yarn global add jest
    ```

## Dependencies

```sh
yarn
```

## Run tests

### Prepare the environment

#### Dev network

```sh
yarn prepare-env-dev --mnemonic-faucet <mnemonic_phrase>
```

* For more flags: ```yarn prepare-env-dev --help```

#### Local network

```sh
yarn prepare-env-local --feeder-key <feeder_key_name>
```

* The 'reserve' account must have funds (in nolus native currency), so be sure to reflect this when starting a local network : **/nolus-core/scripts/init-local-network.sh**

* For more flags: ```yarn prepare-env-local --help```

Example:

```sh
./scripts/init-local-network.sh --reserve-tokens 1000000000000000unls --hermes-mnemonic <hermes_account_mnemonic>
```

!!! On a local network, manual setup and startup of the feeder&&dispatcher is required before testing. Instructions for this can be found in our [**oracle-price-feeder**](https://github.com/Nolus-Protocol/oracle-price-feeder) repository and the name of the feeder key must be passed to the "--feeder-key" flag when running **yarn prepare-env-local** ([here](#local-network)). For some of the test cases, it is necessary to choose a currency for which this feeder does not provide a price. By default, here in the tests, this is set to be the "STARS" currency. So when you configure the feeder, in the configuration file there, please remove this currency from the **currencies** section. An option is provided here to select and specify a currency other than "STARS" via the flag "--no-price-currency" when running **yarn prepare-env-local**.

### Fund wallet with supported currencies - Osmosis Dex

To run the tests, regardless of the exact currency, it is necessary to load the test wallet with all currencies supported by the system. For this purpose you can use the script below, or to do that manually.

!!! Before running the script, you have to fill in it the currencies with which you want the account to be funded. [Look in the script for more](./scripts/helpers/fund-with-supported-currencies.sh).

!!! Osmosis binary is required.

```sh
yarn run fund-main-account <mnemonic_of_osmosis_account_you_have_preloaded> <address_of_osmosis_account_you_have_preloaded>  <nolus_receiver_address> <osmosis_node_url>
```

* Ð¢he osmosis account whose information you submit to the script must be loaded with osmo

* The receiver is the "reserve" address (after running the [environment prep scripts](#prepare-the-environment))

* Some of the parameters in the script have default values for local network - change them with the following flags:

```sh
    [--nolus-node <nolus_network_url>]
    [--nolus-home-dir <nolus_home_dir_path>]
    [--osmosis-home-dir  <osmosis_home_dir_path>]
    [--leaser-contract-address <leaser_contract_addrss]
```

### Run

```sh
yarn test
```

* In **manually/** can be found tests which require specific configuration to work as expected. They require to be run in isolation. The requirements can be found in the relevant files there.
